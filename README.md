# Automated Portfolio Managment

Goals for this project:
- Given a set of possible investments, find optimal asset allocations frontier.
- Requires computing a covariance matrix between strategies; will need to work out estimation strategies for this.
- Pipeline the system so that it is easy to use and extend in the future.

Files:
- efficient_frontier.py: simulates and plots the efficient frontier for a universe of stocks. Plotting parameters at the top of the file.

Currently working on: plotting a bunch of different frontiers for universes to get some intuition for how these plots look
