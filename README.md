# Automated Portfolio Managment

Goals for this project:
- Given a set of possible investments, find optimal asset allocations frontier.
- Requires computing a covariance matrix between strategies; will need to work out estimation strategies for this.
- Pipeline the system so that it is easy to use and extend in the future.

Progress: Just starting out. Going to implement some very basic functions to get a feel for things.
